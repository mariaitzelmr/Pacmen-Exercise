Pacmen Exercise!!!

#Description
Create as many pacman as you want on screen and see them bounce around! Each pacman will have it's own speed and direction, but they wont bounce against each other, that would be fun too.

#How to run
Download the full project, if you keep the files in the same folder, just drop the index.html in your browser to start the game.
If you change the location of the files or if you want to change their names, remember to set the right path and file name in the <script></script> tags in index.html and in pacArray at the top of pacmen.js

#Future improvements!
-Make the pacmen bounce against each other.
-Maybe prepare an HP or stamina property on each pacmen and make them explode when the hp reaches 0.
-At random moments produce a super Pacman that can endure more bounces than the rest!! it might have special effects...
